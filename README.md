# Opsin-tuning

IGOR binaries, CSVs, and numpy binaries for opsin tunings.

### Features of arrays
- X axis: opsin sensitivity, in nm
- Y axis: every possible (and impossible) opsin template, from peak absorption at 0 nm to 700 nm 

### Usage
Find wavelength (in nm) for sought opsin template on Y axis, and extract data along X axis. Once a given template has been extracted, the resulting series contains the relative absorption between 0 nm to 700 nm. 

### Availible in 3 scales:
- Linear (AllOpsin)
- 1 log (AllOpsin1log)
- 1.5 log (AllOpsin1_5log)
- 
Other scales can be derived from linear array.
